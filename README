stereogallery Plugin for DokuWiki

This plugin is a modification of the DokuWiki gallery plugin to show
stereo images in JPS (JPEG Stereo) format on WebXR capable browsers
like the Oculus browser in the Meta Quest or Firefox Reality.

All documentation for this plugin can be found at
http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:stereogallery

If you install this plugin manually, make sure it is installed in
lib/plugins/stereogallery/ - if the folder is called different it
will not work!

Please refer to http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugins for additional info
on how to install plugins in DokuWiki.
